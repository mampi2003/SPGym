      <p class="font">Whether dumbbell or barbell presses are better for growth is an age-old weight-room debate. Luckily, you can do both! But there's little doubt that the dumbbell variation has more versatility throughout the beginning, middle, and end of a chest workout.</p>
      <p class="font"><span style="font-size:36px">Tips:</span>Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which EMG results have shown works the front delts as much as the chest. If possible, go for a lower incline, such as 30 degrees, to focus squarely on the upper pecs.</p>

      <h1 class="large-font" style="color:rgb(124, 10, 73);"><b>Machine Chest Press</b></h1>
      <p> Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great, but machine press and cable press variations have some unique benefits. For one, it's easier to slow down the repetition, both in the concentric and eccentric phases. Stack-loaded machines are also great for quickly doing dropsets.</p>
      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Tips:</span>Machine exercises make the most sense at the end of your workout for sets of at least 8-10 reps, plus dropsets or rest-pause sets if you can handle them. This is when you see if that pre-workout you've been taking can live up to its promises! Pump your pecs until they're seriously fatigued and finish your workout strong.</p>

      <p class="font">Chest flies are one of the most effective exercises for the chest. They can be done at home or in the gym, with weights, bands, or even your body weight. Chest flies are great for beginners and advanced trainers because they target all three heads of your pectoralis major muscle.</p>
      <p class="font"><span style="font-size:36px">Tips:</span> Do your flyes after your presses, either as your first isolation move, or as the final exercise in your workout. There's no need to go heavy! Stick to higher-rep sets, like 10-12 reps or slightly higher.</p>

      <p>When it comes to sculpting your chest, many people turn to the good old bench press. The cable crossover is often overlooked, although it is a great exercise to strengthen your entire chest and has a few perks that the bench press does not.</p>
      <p><span style="font-size:24px">Tips:</span> There are three different ways to do the exercise, depending on how high (or low) you put the handles. Depending on where you put the handle, it also targets different muscles on your chest.</p>
